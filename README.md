Made this little site for myself so I had more customizability for creating color palettes when needed. Features a randomization button, color locking, color deleting and color popping (remove from the far right). This tool was mainly just for myself but feel free to use it as well =)

# How to use

**Shuffle Colors** - Make use of the shuffle icon button which generates an entire new list. Note, every color will be changed if not in a locked state.

**Lock Colors** - If you find a color you fancy, lock it so it doesn't change! You can lock your color by hovering over it and an options menu will appear with a lock button.

**Copying Colors** - Copying a color is fairly easy, click on the circle and a notification will appear denoting a successful copy to the clipboard. 

**Removing Colors** - Want to lower your number count? You have two options, either removing a specific color from the list by hovering over the color and clicking the "X" icon to remove it OR you can hit the minus button at the top options which removes the last placed color (right most). 


# Local Spin up

If you want to locally spin the site up clone the repo and copy paste the following in your terminal

```
npm i & npm start
```

# Comments

If you want a specific feature I'd be happy to add it, as of now it just satisfies what I need it for :^)
