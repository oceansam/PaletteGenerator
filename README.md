Made this little site for myself so I had more customizability for creating color palettes when needed. Features a randomization button, color locking, color deleting and color popping (remove from the far right). This tool was mainly just for myself but feel free to use it as well =)


# Local Spin up

If you want to locally spin the site up clone the repo and copy paste the following in your terminal

```
npm i & npm start
```

# Comments

If you want a specific feature I'd be happy to add it, as of now it just satisfies what I need it for :^)
